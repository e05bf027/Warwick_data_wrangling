Steps needed; NB that ABG data can come from Metavision or the biochem department.

==============
SCRIPTS needed
==============

1) Read in data
    - the formats of Metavision output and the biochem ABG data are different, but
      so have different wrangling requirements.
    - the biochem ABG data is already 'tidy'.
    - this might be bnest handled by creating a folder with some subfolders for each
      patient.
    - eg "Patient X" folder; subfolders "Metavision data", "Biochem_ABG"
    - finished data can go in the main folder
    - So, the script can have options 1 or 2 (or something) for data source?
